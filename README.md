## Usage Guide

Since philosopher emoji are new to many of us, here are some suggestions on appropriate usage. 
Given the subject matter there will naturally be disagreement, and we invite vigorous debate on the correct usage of each emoji.

### Plato

If something is the most perfect representation of its form, `:plato:` is the emoji the situation calls for.

Example: this pull request is `:plato:`

### Popper

When you've realised your tests aren't actually testing anything, your CI server is randomly crashing, or you're having other trouble trying to create a reproducible process, drop a :karl-popper: facepalm into the conversation.

### Kierkegaard

### Wittgenstein

![Wittgenstein](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/underscoreio/philosopher-emoji/master/wittgenstein.png)

When you want to stare moodily into the middle distance, :wittgenstein: has got your back.

Example: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Theorems on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched sets contain themselves near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears...in...rain. Time to die. `:wittgenstein:`

### Sartre

![Sartre](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/underscoreio/philosopher-emoji/master/sartre.png)

### Marx

![Marx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/underscoreio/philosopher-emoji/master/karl-marx.png)

What to let everyone know we're all in it together? Throw in a :karl-marx: to show your comrades that you are united in their struggle.
